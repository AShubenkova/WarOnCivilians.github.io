    <p>
      Professor Sheldon Garon, Principal Investigator of the <em>WAR-ON-CIVILIANS</em> project and Nissan Professor of History at Princeton University, delivered a keynote address at the international conference <strong>"The Second World War: 80 Years On"</strong>, held at King’s College London from 11 to 13 June 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conference was organized by the <strong>Second World War Research Group</strong> to mark the 80th anniversary of the surrender of the Axis powers and the end of the Second World War. The event brought together historians and researchers from around the world to reassess and advance our understanding of the war's global impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      In his keynote, Professor Garon drew on his transnational research into the evolution of wartime civilian targeting and the shaping of “home fronts.” His talk emphasized the interconnected nature of warfare strategies across nations and the legacy of these practices in the modern world. The lecture sparked discussion about new comparative methodologies and historical frameworks in the study of total war.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the global community reflects on this historic anniversary, the conference provided an opportunity to not only celebrate past scholarly achievements but also to promote future directions for research.
